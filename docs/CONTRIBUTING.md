## Github

The prerequisite is to learn Git, the version control system required.

For more information about Git, read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git).

For more information about Version Control System, read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control).

Once you think you're ready, download git for your platform [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

To let you get started with some of the git functionality, you have these resources.

I recommend you to try these out.

* https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1
* https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
* https://www.git-tower.com/blog/posts/git-cheat-sheet

Next, get yourself a Github account, because that is how you're going to work with the project.
